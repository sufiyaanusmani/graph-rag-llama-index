A **knowledge graph** is like a smart map of information. It connects pieces of data (like facts, people, places, or things) in a way that shows how they are related to each other. Think of it as a web of knowledge where every "dot" represents an item and every "line" shows how those items are connected.

For example:

- **Dot:** "Elon Musk"
- **Connected dots:** "Tesla," "SpaceX," "CEO"

The graph would show Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. This structure helps systems like Google or AI assistants understand and answer questions more effectively because they can see relationships and context, not just isolated facts.
